Short little note on these files. 

Never really understood the idea of Twitter and limiting one to 140 characters. Using Python and various other sources
to tweet things for me. The items tweeted, current news stories, a daily comic strip, and 'this day in history' reflect
things I find interesting*.

* The actual content of the story, comic, etc may not actually be something I agree with, remember these 
  are posted without me reading them first.
