Short little note on these files. 

Never really understood the idea of Twitter and limiting one to 140 characters.
Uses Python and various other sources to tweet things for me.
The items tweeted: current news stories, 
                   a daily comic strip,
                   'this day in history' 

Items reflect things I find interesting*.

* The actual content of the status may not.
